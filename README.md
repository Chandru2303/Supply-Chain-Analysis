# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting key supply chain metrics such as **revenue generated by product types**, using real-world structured data. The primary goal is to build data-driven insights for better inventory management and supply chain decision-making.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- ✅ Time series forecasting for top product types
- 🚚 Minimize delivery costs *(To be implemented)*
- 🏪 Optimize inventory replenishment *(Partially done via forecasting)*
- ⏱️ Balance shipping time vs. cost *(To be implemented)*

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, Prophet, matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **GitHub**
- *(Tableau / Power BI for future dashboard visualization)*

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- ⏳ **Time Series Forecasting**:
  - Used Facebook's `Prophet` library to forecast revenue for the top product types: `cosmetics`, `haircare`, `skincare`.
  - Data grouped and aggregated on a **monthly** basis.
  - Forecasts saved in both `.csv` and `.png` formats.

- 📁 **Forecast Results**:
  - Stored in the `/forecasts` folder
  - Includes visual charts and raw prediction data for each product type

## 📂 Repository Structure

## 📈 Next Steps

- Implement **linear programming** to minimize delivery costs
- Optimize **inventory replenishment** using EOQ or safety stock models
- Visualize KPIs in **Tableau or Power BI**
- Build a **dashboard** to monitor product performance and logistics metrics
